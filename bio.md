##What I like
- **Soccer** is my sport, played it since I was **7**. *LOL* is my game, I rock with all ADCs... *psych* Im not that good but it is enjoyable... *but super smash on the other hand, I dominate!*
  - I also enjoy meeting new people, life is wayyyyy too short to be shy or lazy...
  - Also, *"I believe everyone can teach you something..."* Poetic I know :D
- On a more serious note, CS is the only thing that can **intelletually hold my interest**, I am very *intrigued with the security side of things.* I am really looking forward to another **busy** quarter!

##Programming Background
> Really not much to say here, I orignally graduated in Economics.. As I mentioned a section earlier CS is the only thing that can intelletually hold my interest. It's almost amazing how each day I still start off amazed at how much more there is to know!

Oh man, I really should have read ahead and not typed in my programming backgroud '-_-

My **FAVORITE** project from last quarter was definately the Game of Life simulaor; it was a pain in the butt to build and in all honestly I don't think I fully understand how much of a marval that simulation is..

Uh-oh, I just read we are going to merge the branch to the master.. Not sure how pretty this is going to look

The merge and using everything through the git shell is definately the most difficult part so far 

#This is the final change!
