##What I like
- **Soccer** is my sport, played it since I was **7**. *LOL* is my game, I rock with all ADCs... *psych* Im not that good but it is enjoyable... *but super smash on the other hand, I dominate!*
  - I also enjoy meeting new people, life is wayyyyy too short to be shy or lazy...
  - Also, *"I believe everyone can teach you something..."* Poetic I know :D
- On a more serious note, CS is the only thing that can **intelletually hold my interest**, I am very *intrigued with the security side of things.* I am really looking forward to another **busy** quarter!

##Programming Background
> Really not much to say here, I orignally graduated in Economics.. As I mentioned a section earlier CS is the only thing that can intelletually hold my interest. It's almost amazing how each day I still start off amazed at how much more there is to know!

Uh-oh, I just read we are going to merge the branch to the master.. Not sure how pretty this is going to look
